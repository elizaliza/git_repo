### Git Commands  # ``` -uptakes

```

```
git reset

```
git status
```
This command lists all the files that have to be tracked and/or commited. 

```
git rm filename
```
This command will delete the file and the staging area will know about deletion of the file. (when we use "git add command- usually it pushes files to the staging area)

```
rm -f filename
```
This command will delete the file, but it will not be updated on the staging area, staging area will not be aware of the file deletion. In this scenario we need to do several steps to let the staging area know about changes that were made.  (Nothing can be commited, until they are staged)

```
git log
```
This command show if commit was made.

```
git show commitid
```
This command will show you details of the commit.

```
git revert
```
Git revert is dangerous, couse it is going to delete. This command will revert back file from the commit.

```
git branch branch/name
```
This command will create a new branch with branch/name. You can choose any name that you want. 

```
git checkout -b branch/name
```
This command will create a new branch with branch/name and switch to it. It is a combination of two commands "git branch branch/name and git checkout branch/name"

```
git checkout branch/name
```
This command will switch branch to branch/name branch. 

```
git branch -d branch/name(local-branch-name) 
```
This command will delete brach called branch/name. Note: In some cases, Git might refuse to delete your local branch: when it contains commits that haven't been merged into any other local branches or pushed to a remote repository. This is a very sensible rule that protects you from inadvertently losing commit data.

```
git branch -D <local-branch-name>
```
This will force deletion of the branch, even if it contains unmerged / unpushed commits. It goes without saying: please be careful with this command.

```
git push origin --delete <remote-branch-name>
```
To delete a remote branch.

```
git fetch
```
This command will check if there is any difference between your cloned repository/local repository and remote repository. fetch will not copy anything, it will just fo and check the remote and that's it. Read about git pull..

```
git pull
```
This command will go and check your remote repository for changes and will copy changes to your local repository. See the difference between fetch and pull. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-fetch-vs-pull/#:~:text=git%20fetch%20is%20the%20command,changes%20from%20the%20remote%20repository.
